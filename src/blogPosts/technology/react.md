In Dostoevsky’s “Notes from the Underground”, the “Crystal Palace” symbolises the ideal that humanity is able to be constructed through strict adherence to rationalism and an means of conduct, which emphasises the fundamental wants, and motivations of humanity. These wants are listed being happiness, freedom, prosperity, and security. If humanity could define these wants and calculate how it is that an individual had to conduct themselves in order to gain such wants, then the “Crystal Palace” would be constructed upon earth.
Dostoevsky’s Underground Man, argues that the preceding things listed that account for the individuals well-being, that there happens to be something that is left out of all lists that attempt to rationalise human conduct, something that would breakdown all coherence and rationalisation of humanity. The thing that’s left from the list is ‘whim’, and with this whim that so often goes against seemingly one’s basic interests is ‘the most advantageous advantage’. It’s so because through acting impetuously or whimsically the individual states there own individuality, their own will. Whether it be in order to good or bad, that’s not the point, but rather in order to take one’s will into one’s own hands is the fundamental advantage because it rectifies the individual.

“For this stupidest of all, this caprice of ours, gentlemen, may in fact be the most profitable of anything on earth for our sort, especially in certain cases. And in particular it may be more profitable than all other profits even in the case when it is obviously harmful and contradicts the most sensible conclusions of our reason concerning profits—because in any event it preserves for us the chiefest and dearest thing, that is, our personality and our individuality.”
